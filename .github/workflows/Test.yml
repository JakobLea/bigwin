# The following workflow provides an opinionated template you can customize for your own needs.
#
# If you are not an Octopus user, the "Push to Octopus", "Generate Octopus Deploy build information",
# and "Create Octopus Release" steps can be safely deleted.
#
# To configure Octopus, set the OCTOPUS_API_TOKEN secret to the Octopus API key, and
# set the OCTOPUS_SERVER_URL secret to the Octopus URL.
#
# Double check the "project" and "deploy_to" properties in the "Create Octopus Release" step
# match your Octopus projects and environments.
#
# Get a trial Octopus instance from https://octopus.com/start
